Simple, include all links

```astro
---
import { SocialShare } from "astro-social-share";
---

<SocialShare
    description="Description of the page/post"
    title="Page Title"
/>
```

If you'd like to customize the share bar you can import the individual buttons and pass them into the `<SocialShare />` component.

```astro
---
import { 
  FacebookShareButton,
  HackerNewsShareButton,
  LinkedInShareButton,
  RedditShareButton,
  TwitterShareButton,
  WhatsAppShareButton,
  SocialShare
} from "astro-social-share";

const BUTTONS = [TwitterShareButton, FacebookShareButton]
---

<SocialShare
    buttons={BUTTONS}
    description="Description of the page/post"
    title="Page Title"
/>
```

## Using your own icons

If you'd like to pass in your own icons you can do so through the individual components.

```astro
---
import { 
  FacebookShareButton,
  TwitterShareButton,
} from "astro-social-share";

---

<FacebookShareButton>
  <svg>...</svg>
</FacebookShareButton>

<TwitterShareButton
    description="Description of the page/post"
    via="YourXAccount"
    title="Page Title"
>
  <img ... />
</TwitterShareButton>
```

## Using your own CSS

If you'd like to style the share bar and icons you can pass in a global `<style>` component to a slot named `astro-social-share-css`

```astro
<SocialShare
    description="Description of the page/post"
    via="YourXAccount"
    title="Page Title"
>
<slot name="astro-social-share-css">
  <style is:global>
    .astro-social-share {
        margin: 20px 0px;
        height: 24px;
    }
    .astro-social-share a {
        text-decoration: none;
        margin-right: 10px;
    }
    .astro-social-share svg {
        height: 24px;
    }
  </style>
</slot>
```
